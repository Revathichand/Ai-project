FASHION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING AI AND PAGERANK ALGORITHM 
Introduction
            This project implements a fashion recommendation system using the PageRank algorithm. The system suggests fashion items based on their relevance and popularity within a fashion graph.

Getting Started
          To get started with the fashion recommendation system, follow these steps:

Data Collection: Gather data on fashion items, including attributes such as style, color, size, brand, and price. This data will serve as the basis for building the fashion graph.

Build the Fashion Graph: Represent the fashion items as nodes in a graph. Each node represents an item, and edges represent relationships between items, such as similarity or compatibility. For example, if two items are frequently bought together, they should have a higher edge weight.

Implement the PageRank Algorithm: Utilize the PageRank algorithm to rank the fashion items within the graph based on their importance and relevance. This algorithm will calculate a score for each item, indicating its likelihood of being recommended.

Generate Recommendations: Once the PageRank algorithm is applied, generate recommendations by selecting the top-ranked fashion items from the graph. These items are considered the most relevant and popular within the fashion network.

Usage:
To use the fashion recommendation system:

Input your preferences, such as preferred style, color, and budget.
                  The system will process your preferences and calculate recommendations based on the fashion graph and PageRank algorithm.
                  Receive a list of recommended fashion items tailored to your preferences and the popularity within the fashion network.
Example:
                Suppose youâ€™re interested in purchasing a new dress. By using the fashion recommendation system, you can input your preferred style (e.g., casual, formal), color (e.g., black, blue), and budget range. The system will then analyze the fashion graph and apply the PageRank algorithm to suggest the most relevant and popular dresses that match your criteria.

Conclusion:
                     By implementing a fashion recommendation system using the PageRank algorithm, users can receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences and the popularity of fashion items within the network. This approach enhances the shopping experience by providing tailored suggestions that align with individual tastes and trends.
